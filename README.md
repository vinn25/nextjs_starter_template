## 📝 About the Project  
NutriTrack is a web application designed for small to medium gym management or individual users who want to track their calorie intake and nutrition. It offers:  
- A user-friendly interface built with Next.js and TypeScript  
- A modular UI using Tailwind CSS for fast styling and responsiveness  
- State management via Redux (as you’re already using)  
- Back-end APIs (you and your teammate Wahid are building) for nutrition data and user flows  
- Designed to be extendable: e.g., food log history, dashboard visualisation of nutrition, export of data

The project aligns with your (the user’s) final-year academic project: “Pengembangan Sistem Manajemen Gym Berbasis Web … dengan Analisis Visual Data Member …”. While this repo focuses on the calorie & nutrition calculator side, it can also integrate into a larger gym-management system.

## ✨ Features  
- Calculate daily calorie needs based on user metrics (age, gender, weight, height, activity level)  
- Input consumption of food items and compute macro-nutrients (protein, carbs, fats)  
- Visual dashboard summarising nutrition intake  
- Responsive design supporting desktop and mobile  
- Ready to be extended: e.g., integrate with gym member profiles, schedule tracking, analytics dashboards  

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) with TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **State Management**: Redux  
- **Backend (planned/optional)**: API routes within Next.js acting as serverless endpoints or standard Node.js backend  
- **Database (optional)**: Prisma + PostgreSQL or another SQL store  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (or similar) for easy hosting and CI/CD
